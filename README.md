I got interested in options trading strategies so I [started with this ChatGPT Session](https://chatgpt.com/share/687ee11f-a890-800f-96e7-a93381812d91) to get an idea of how to set up an automated trading screener. This is a simple stock & option screener to find suitable entry points for options. 


TODO ideas:
* Add dynamic lists using the screener in yfinance.EquityQuery
* Try new strategy, maybe index with 3 days of down volume -> buy puts
* MACD cross signal should happen in negative territory.
